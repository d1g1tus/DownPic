# DownPic - Alpha 1.0



### Downloading and Installing DownPic
----------------------------------------------------

__1. Option__ -> *Download an Installer*

I'm currently working on this feature. It will be available soon

__2. Option__ -> *Download the whole repository as Zip*

❗❗❗ ⚠ __Main installation path HAS TO BE the following ->__ "C:\Program Files\DownPic\" ⚠ ❗❗❗

*Otherwise DownPic won't work. Converserly, you might change default paths on "Default_Variables" and "Variables" to fit your preferences*



### Set Up - Running DownPic
-----------------------------------------------------

__Running DownPic__ is quite simple. You only need to run python command on shell with the following default path: 

"C:/Program Files/DownPic/Launcher - DownPic.py"

So, for the __Setup__ you could create your own bat, to run launcher.py or use my Setup.bat.

# A SIMPLE HOW TO FOR DOWNPIC

### MAIN FEATURES

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/M99Tkb0/Main1.png)

__1. Name, Var1 and Var2__ -> These are some input vars for the final user to use in order to classify their downloads. If non set they will not be added. Adittionally, these vars are used to name each download directory. By default any set of links will have a header with the following static vars:

 - GROUP -> It is use only for the sake of order. 
 - Picture -> This is the default name that will be assignated for folders and files in case no name is given. 
 - Date -> This will be the final download folder, and where all the pictures will actually be downloaded.

__2. Set Parameters__ -> This button will append "Name, Var1 and Var2" as a header to the current log.txt file. You can have as many headers as you want, even if they hold no links. Folders will still be created but no file will be downloaded inside them.

__3. Download__ -> This button will make a pop-up information window to appear, just for the user to know everything's correct and that downloading is about to begin. You have to press Accept in order to start downloading files. While the process is on DownPic will probably freeze until it's over, and another pop-up window appears to indicate that all files have been successfully retrieved.
